# MLP Iris Classifier – Assignment Submission

This repository contains the assignment submission for the *Machine Learning and Neural Networks* module. The project focuses on building, tuning, and evaluating a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier on the Iris dataset.

## 📁 Files

- `MLP_Iris_Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb` – Final Jupyter notebook with all code and outputs
- `MLP_Iris_Report.docx` – Full report with explanations, tables, results, and figures

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Preprocessing and visualization (pairplot, PCA)
- MLP with different activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Logistic)
- Model tuning: hidden layers, solver, and architecture
- Learning curve, loss curve, validation curve
- Noise robustness and overfitting/underfitting testing
- Final evaluation using confusion matrices and classification report

## 🎯 Results Summary

- Best model: MLP (10, 5) with **logistic activation** and **adam solver**
- Achieved **100% accuracy**
- Robust under noise (σ ≤ 0.1), with slight drop at higher noise
